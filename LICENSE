License Notes

burgled-batteries began life as patches to pyffi by Dmitri Hrapof
<hrapof@common-lisp.ru>, which was LGPL.  Because there is essentially
nothing left of pyffi, I felt it acceptable to relicense to something better
suited to the Lisp ecosystem.  However, I am not a lawyer nor versed in the
intricasies of copyright law, so include this warning that you may avoid the
difficulties posed by the LGPL if you feel my opinion is unwarranted or
misinformed.
